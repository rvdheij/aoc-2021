# Solution in REXX

For this one, we can do a simple solution in REXX. It
takes a bit more code, but does the job well. We
simply run a loop to generate the points on each line.
After that, CMS Pipelines does a ```sort count``` and
we count the number of points with score 2 or more.
```
/* MAKEVENT REXX                                                     */

  if y1 > y2 then dy = -1
  do while x1 <> x2 | y1 <> y2
    'output' right(x1,10)right(y1,10)
    x1 = x1 + dx
    y1 = y1 + dy
  end
  'output' right(x1,10)right(y1,10)
  'readto'
end

```
This takes a while to run, and it is not unlikely a pure
pipeline solution would be quicker.
```
PIPE < input005 txt | makevent  | chop 20 | sort count | pick w1 >= ,2, | count
6856
Ready; T=3.18/3.20 11:37:29
```

## Second Part

For the second part we need to include the diagonals as well. We revisit the pro
first part and remove the ```if``` clause that excluded the diagonals. Instead,
to show whether the points are for a diagonal line, and select on that.
```
  diag = abs(dx*dy)
```
Now we can use the same pipeline stage for both challenges.
```
pipe < input005 txt | makevent | pick w3 = ,0, | chop 20 | sort count | pick w1 >= ,2, | count lines | cons
6856
Ready; T=3.10/3.11 11:41:26
pipe < input005 txt | makevent |                 chop 20 | sort count | pick w1 >= ,2, | count lines | cons
20666
Ready; T=3.19/3.20 11:41:47
```
Note that the runtime for both is almost the same, so we can see the excessive
cost was in generating the individual points, not in counting the results.

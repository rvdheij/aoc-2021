# Parsing Brackets

This is fairly easy to do with a REXX program going through the
characters of a line. Obviously CMS Pipelines does a nice job
adding up the score for each line.
```
PIPE < small010 txt | day10a | pick w2 == ,bad, | cons
      1197 bad
         3 bad
        57 bad
         3 bad
     25137 bad
Ready; T=0.01/0.01 23:09:18
PIPE < small010 txt | day10a | pick w2 == ,bad, | day10b | cons
      26397
Ready; T=0.01/0.01 23:09:27
```
The same REXX program was made to compute the score for short
input strings based on the missing characters. The challenge
for these is to find the *middle* score. That is very easy to
do with CMS Pipelines using the ```snake``` stage.
With ```snake 2``` we arrange the records in two columns as
shown below:
```
pipe literal 1 2 3 4 5 | split | snake 2 | cons
14
25
3
Ready; T=0.01/0.01 23:26:15
```
Since it is given that we have an odd number of values, the middle number
will be on the last line (by itself).
```
PIPE < input010 txt | day10a | pick w2 == ,short, | sort | snake 2 | take last | cons
          1118976874
```

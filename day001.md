To compare numbers in consecutive lines, create lines with pairs of numbers from consecutive lines. Like this:
```
pipe literal 1 2 3 4 5 | split | dup | drop | drop last | join , , | cons
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
Ready; T=0.01/0.01 10:15:25
```
Since the number in our data are not all the same length, we need to right-justify them to do a string comparison.
```
PIPE < input001 txt | spec w1 1.6 r | dup | drop | drop last | join , , | pick 1.6 << 8.6 | count lines | cons
1400
Ready; T=0.02/0.02 10:20:26
```
## Subroutine
It is convenient to put that pair-wise comparison in a subroutine pipeine.
```
